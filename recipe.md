1) In a large bowl, take 2.5 to 2.75 cups of chilled whipping cream (30% to 50% fat). Add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. If using vanilla essence, then add 1 teaspoon of it.

2) With an electric beater at full speed, begin to whip the cream. Timing will vary depending on the fat content in the cream. Both for amul fresh cream and amul whipping cream, it takes about 8 to 10 minutes. 

3) Also be careful while whipping and do not whip too much, as then the cream would get churned into butter.

4) Whip till stiff peaks are formed. You can also whip till soft peaks. If using 25% fat cream, then you can whip till soft peaks.

5) Now add 400 grams of chilled sweetened condensed milk (about 1.6 cups).

6) Fold gently but very well. Also remember not to overfold as then the ice cream mixture can fall flat.

7) Remove the vanilla ice cream mixture in a container or box and then cover it tightly. Or you can cover the same bowl (if its freezer safe) with a tight fitting lid or aluminium foil.

8) Freeze till the ice cream is set. Before serving, keep the ice cream box or bowl for some minutes at room temperature. Then using a scoop, remove the ice cream.

9) Serve vanilla ice cream. You can sprinkle some chocolate chips or grated chocolate or candied fruits or even tutti frutti from top if you want.
